## MetaMemory Document Server

A shared memory server stores documents as organized Markdown files in a folder tree.
Server URL: !`echo ${META_MEMORY_URL:-${MEMORY_SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:8100}}`

### When to Use
- User asks to "remember", "save", "note down" something
- You discover important project knowledge worth preserving
- You need context from previous sessions or other agents' work
- After completing research or analysis that should be shared

### Quick Commands (mm shortcut)

The `mm` CLI is pre-installed and handles auth automatically. **Always prefer `mm` over raw curl:**

```bash
# Read
mm search <query>              # Search documents
mm get <doc_id>                # Get document by ID
mm path </folder/doc-slug>     # Get document by path
mm list [folder_id]            # List documents (default: root)
mm folders                     # Browse folder tree

# Write
mm create <title> [opts] [content]   # Create document
    --folder <id>   Target folder (default: root)
    --tags <a,b>    Comma-separated tags
    --by <name>     Creator name
    # Content via stdin (recommended for multiline):
    echo '# My Doc' | mm create "Title" --folder FOLDER_ID --tags "dev" --by "bot-name"

mm update <doc_id> [opts] [content]  # Update document
    --title <t>     New title
    --tags <a,b>    New tags
    echo '# Updated' | mm update DOC_ID

mm mkdir <name> [parent_id]    # Create folder (default parent: root)
mm delete <doc_id>             # Delete document

# System
mm health                      # Health check
```

All write commands handle JSON escaping safely (multiline content, special characters).
For stdin content, pipe markdown: `cat notes.md | mm create "Notes" --folder ID`

### Guidelines
- Write documents as structured Markdown with clear headings
- Use descriptive titles and relevant tags
- Organize into folders by project or topic
- Before creating, search first to avoid duplicates (`mm search <query>`)
- Update existing docs rather than creating new ones when appropriate
- Include created_by to track which agent wrote the document
